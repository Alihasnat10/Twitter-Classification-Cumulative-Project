# Twitter-Classification-Cumulative-Project
In the first part, we will make a system that predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. In the second part of this project, we will test the power of Naive Bayes classifiers by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris.
